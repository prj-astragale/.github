### Project Summary

Conservation and restoration of built heritage are now commonly supported by scientific analysis, especially in structural assessment. The stability and condition of components are evaluated through materials science and civil engineering, supplemented by archaeometry and art history. This collaborative research, rooted in architectural surveys, is exemplified by the Notre-Dame de Paris scientific project, with partner laboratories MAP (Digital Ecosystem) and LMGC (Structural Analysis). Involved in projects such as the nDame ecosystem, ANR DEMMEFI (studying fire-induced structural damage), and interdisciplinary efforts like REPERAGE (MAP/LRMH/SRA), the ASTRAGALE project primarily focuses on Notre-Dame’s masonry structures, with potential expansion to its timber frame.

However, the data generated from varied observations, representations, and interpretations are highly heterogeneous. This is compounded by the complexities of architectural and structural data, from in situ material inspections and historical archives to lab tests and computational models for mechanical analysis. Consequently, disconnected, linear methodologies emerge rather than cyclic, integrated processes, due to interface challenges between survey, modeling, structural analysis, and representation.

ASTRAGALE aims to bridge architectural survey data with structural models, creating a coherent data integration. Extracted data from simulations will correlate visible alterations with internal weaknesses or load concentration patterns identified through structural analysis. This approach enables machine learning applications for correlating damage patterns. Using the CIDOC CRM, Web Annotation Data Model, and a rigorous methodology, ASTRAGALE prioritizes high interoperability and reproducibility.

The complementary expertise of the partner labs was previously demonstrated through the ANR MONUMENTUM project, integrating MAP’s collaborative surveying and digital modeling with LMGC’s discrete-element structural analysis, forming a robust conceptual and technological foundation. Tasks are organized according to the data lifecycle, with a focus on capturing geometric survey data and its translation into structural calculation models. A collaborative environment will be implemented at the prototyping stage to build a reproducible analytical framework.
