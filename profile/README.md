## 🔦 Project Summary
Ensuring the resilience of our built environment requires a comprehensive understanding of structural behavior, particularly when it comes to cultural heritage buildings. These structures are defined not only by their historical and architectural value but also by unique material compositions, specialized construction methods, and conservation challenges. *Astragale* addresses these needs by enhancing data-sharing and computational support, enabling a collaborative environment that bridges disciplines.

In line with the endeavours of the [n-Dame_Heritage](http://www.ndameheritage.map.cnrs.fr/) and the Notre-Dame de Paris Ecosystems, *Astragale* aims at facilitating knowledge exchange among civil engineers, architects, and conservation scientists. 

Central to the project is a modular, Knowledge Graph-based framework utilizing Semantic Web technologies. This approach enables structured, interoperable solutions that preserve and share knowledge on heritage buildings’ structural integrity and long-term preservation, fostering a robust foundation for interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative conservation practices.

**Project Focus**
Astragale focuses on bridging architectural survey data with structural models. Extracted data from simulations will correlate visible alterations with internal weaknesses or load concentration

Conservation and restoration of built heritage are now commonly supported by scientific analysis, especially in structural assessment. The stability and condition of components are evaluated through materials science and civil engineering, supplemented by archaeometry and art history. This collaborative research, rooted in architectural surveys, is exemplified by the Notre-Dame de Paris scientific project, with partner laboratories MAP (Digital Ecosystem) and LMGC (Structural Analysis). Involved in projects such as the nDame ecosystem, ANR DEMMEFI (studying fire-induced structural damage), and interdisciplinary efforts like REPERAGE (MAP/LRMH/SRA), the ASTRAGALE project primarily focuses on Notre-Dame’s masonry structures, with potential expansion to its timber frame.

However, the data generated from varied observations, representations, and interpretations are highly heterogeneous. This is compounded by the complexities of architectural and structural data, from in situ material inspections and historical archives to lab tests and computational models for mechanical analysis. Consequently, disconnected, linear methodologies emerge rather than cyclic, integrated processes, due to interface challenges between survey, modeling, structural analysis, and representation.

ASTRAGALE aims to bridge architectural survey data with structural models, creating a coherent data integration. Extracted data from simulations will correlate visible alterations with internal weaknesses or load concentration patterns identified through structural analysis. This approach enables machine learning applications for correlating damage patterns. Using the CIDOC CRM, Web Annotation Data Model, and a rigorous methodology, ASTRAGALE prioritizes high interoperability and reproducibility.

The complementary expertise of the partner labs was previously demonstrated through the ANR MONUMENTUM project, integrating MAP’s collaborative surveying and digital modeling with LMGC’s discrete-element structural analysis, forming a robust conceptual and technological foundation. Tasks are organized according to the data lifecycle, with a focus on capturing geometric survey data and its translation into structural calculation models. A collaborative environment will be implemented at the prototyping stage to build a reproducible analytical framework.
